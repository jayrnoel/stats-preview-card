### What I learned

I have used this challenge to apply what I have learned over the last month. My initial submittion is timed within an hour and I have edited this from feedback I received.

A new knowledge I have acquired in this is how to make overlay on image. I have also learned blending mode in CSS.

```
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
```

### Useful resources

- blending mode for css (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode]
